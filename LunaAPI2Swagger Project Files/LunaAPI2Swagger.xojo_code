		Generate Swagger 2.0 (Open API) spec from your Xojo Program
		------------------------------------------------------------
		
		
		
		Based on api2swagger (https://github.com/anil614sagar/api2swagger)
		------------------------------------------------------------------
		
		The original API2Swagger source code this was based on can be found in relevant notes for the following modules/classes
		
		Xojo Folder     | Xojo Section       |  api2swagger folder | api2swagger source code note
		-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		api2swagger/lib | module errorCodes  | lib/errorCodes      | command.js
		api2swagger/lib | module execute     | lib/execute         | api.js
		api2swagger/lib | module questions   | lib/questions       | aboutq.js
		api2swagger/lib | module questions   | lib/questions       | apiq.js
		api2swagger/lib | module util        | lib/util            | cli.js
		api2swagger/bin | module bin         | bin                 | api2swagger
		
		
		
		JSONItem_MTC (https://github.com/ktekinay/JSONItem_MTC)
		-------------------------------------------------------------
		This is a drop-in replacements for the native JSONItem. It emulates all its features but should perform certain functions faster.
		
		RB-URI (https://github.com/charonn0/RB-URI)
		-------------------------------------------
		This project implements a set of REALstudio object classes which together allow for easy manipulation of URIs. 
		Strictly speaking, only the URL subset of the URI specification is supported. Other subsets like URNs are not supported.
		Used here for parsing of the URLs
		
		Uses the following Node modules:
		-------------------------------
		
		node-http-status (https://github.com/adaltas/node-http-status) 
		--------------------------------------------------------------------
		(Required by api2swagger, see api2swagger/lib/execute/api.js note)
		We're only using their Status Codes which are located in Node_Modules/node-http-status/nodehttpstatus.jHTTPStatus
		A HTTP Status Code is translated to a description (or reverse) with the nodehttpstatus.HTTPStatusDescription function
		
		json-schema-generator (https://github.com/krg7880/json-schema-generator)
		------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		(Required by api2swagger, see api2swagger/lib/execute/api.js note)
		The jsonToSchema function is located in Node_Modules/json-schema-generator/jsonschemagenerator
		The original json-schema-generator source code this was based on can be found in relevant notes for the following modules/classes
		
		Xojo Folder               | Xojo Section                 |  json-schema-generator folder | api2swagger source code note
		-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		json-schema-generator/lib | class AST                    | lib                           | ast.js
		json-schema-generator/lib | class jscompiler             | lib                           | compiler.js
		json-schema-generator/lib | module utils                 | lib                           | utils.js
		json-schema-generator     | module jsonschemagenerator   | lib                           | index.js
